# Mapping_Earthquakes
In this project we explored visualization tools with earthquake data. We created an interactive map that show the different locations and magnitudes of major and minor earthquakes.


Below are pictures of each our map with each of our layers. The legend shows the magnitude of the earthquakes over the last seven days. We also show major earthquakes over the last week with a magnitude greater than 4.5. We have also added tectonic plates to our map.
